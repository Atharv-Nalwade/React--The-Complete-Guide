In react we handle events with props which startt with "On" they require a value which is a function which is called when the event happens
Eg:   <button onClick={()=>{console.log("athu")}}>Change</button>
       OR
       const clickhandler = () =>{  log("ok" }
       <button onClick={clickHandler}>Change</button>
       
 
 Good practice is to end the func. name with handler for event func.
 
 Normally when we trya change a value in return of a component using a j svariable that doesnt work as the file or component is rendered only once and thus the vaibale value will naver be shoin in the broweser
 
 Hooks start with use keyword  they cannot be used inside nested function and can be used only inside functions
 
 change in a var will lead to calling of rendering component again 
 
 useState(default_variable_od_value)
 It returns an array  
 first ele is the value itself and second si the updating function 
 
 const [title,setTitle] = useState(props.title) intially tilte is equl to props.title or current state value  
 and setTitle is the function used to set the new value 
 It returns a pair of values: the current state and a function that updates it
 
 the useState(props.tile) is the default statee or the one send by props 
 
 the useState is component based even if they are many same components then aslo it affects only its own 
 
 Also later times when the component is reinitialized that timw the default val. is not considered only the current is considered the past value is tken care of 
 
 <input type="number" min='0.01' step='0.01' />

 The onchange event occurs when the value of an element has been changed.

For radiobuttons and checkboxes, the onchange event occurs when the checked state has been changed.

Tip: This event is similar to the oninput event. The difference is that the oninput event occurs immediately after the value of an element has changed, while onchange occurs when the element loses focus, after the content has been changed. The other difference is that the onchange event also works on <select> elements. 

    const titleChangeHandler=() =>{
    console.log("title changed")
   }
 <input type="text" onChange={titleChangeHandler} />   to  call the ufnction on change
