in recat style is in { { ---} }

Inline Styles:

<label style={{ color: !isValid ? "red" : "black" }}>Course Goal</label>
In recat while adding style css prop is camelcase property of css version eg background-color is bcakgroundColor

Dynamic class:
   The class is not dynamic bt the compnent to which it is added is dyamically selected
   Eg. <div className={`form-control ${!isValid ? "invalid" : ""}`}>
                                here syntax ${} allows us to add someting using js in a string 
                                thus here the class for the comonent is dynamic
    
    ${} is a placeholder for the template literal
